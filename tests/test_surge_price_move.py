"""The percentage move on a surge -- the figure the strip and the alert are
actually read for.

It is measured two ways on purpose. DexScreener's priceChange.m5 is what the
rest of the site shows, so it wins when it exists. But on brand-new pairs --
exactly the ones that surge -- that field is regularly absent or flat zero,
and a surge card showing no percentage is the one failure worth engineering
around. So the radar also measures the move across its own price samples.

These check the second one is real arithmetic on real samples, and that it is
never passed off as a five-minute number when it covers a different period.

The real _evaluate is extracted from surge_radar.py; nothing is stubbed but
the module-level constants it reads."""
