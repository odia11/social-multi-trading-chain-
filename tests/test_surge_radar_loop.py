"""Runs surge_radar's real sampling loop against a fake market, to prove the
alert wiring the unit tests only assert about actually fires end to end.

The unit tests check that notify_surge decides correctly when it is called.
This checks that it IS called -- on every sweep for a live surge, not just on
the first detection, which is what lets a token that keeps climbing earn a
second alert. Nothing else is ever pushed: a falling token is refused by the
radar itself, so it never reaches the alert path at all.

dashboard is replaced by a stub module before surge_radar imports it."""
