"""URLs in a post become links -- without becoming an injection hole.

A post is text a stranger typed. Turning any of it into HTML is the moment
that matters, so most of these are about what must NOT come out: no
javascript: link, no tag that survives escaping, and no @mention rule running
inside an href, which would rewrite the middle of a URL into a link of its
own.

The real functions are lifted out of static/dashboard.js and run in node."""
