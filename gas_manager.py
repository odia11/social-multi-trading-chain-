"""Periodic background safety net that keeps every user's EVM trading wallet
(BSC, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Robinhood Chain) topped up with native gas
(BNB/ETH/POL) -- so a wallet whose trading capital sits entirely in USDC
never gets stuck unable to broadcast a buy or sell for lack of a few cents
of gas, even between trades.

This module deliberately does NOT reimplement any swap, bridge, or key
decryption logic. dashboard.py's _ensure_evm_gas() -- already called right
before every EVM buy/sell -- is the one and only place that decides whether
a wallet needs gas and executes it:
  - a low-but-nonzero balance is topped up with a same-chain USDC -> native
    swap via the 0x API (_execute_evm_gas_topup)
  - a completely empty (0) balance is bootstrapped by bridging a small,
    fixed amount of the user's own SOL into native gas on that chain
    (_bootstrap_evm_gas_via_bridge), since a same-chain swap can't pay for
    its own broadcast from literal zero
Reusing that single function here means this sweep can never drift out of
sync with the per-trade path or apply a different threshold, and the
per-(wallet, chain) lock inside _ensure_evm_gas() itself (see dashboard.py)
keeps this background sweep and a live trade's own gas check from ever
firing two top-ups for the same wallet at once.

All this module adds is the SCHEDULE: walk every user with an EVM trading
key configured, across every chain they actually hold USDC on, on a timer --
so a dip in gas (network fee drift, an outgoing transfer, etc.) gets caught
proactively instead of only at the moment of a trade.

Deliberately skips a chain entirely when the user holds no USDC there and
has no open position on it: _ensure_evm_gas()'s zero-balance branch spends
the user's own SOL bootstrapping gas, and every chain starts at a native
balance of 0 for a wallet that's never touched it -- sweeping unconditionally
would silently spend SOL bootstrapping gas on chains the user never asked to
trade on. Gating on "do they have capital or a position there" keeps this
strictly a safety net for chains actually in use.

Never decrypts a private key just to check a balance: the EVM address is
already stored in plaintext (users.bsc_wallet_address -- see dashboard.py's
ensure_bsc_wallet()), so the balance/USDC pre-check below is two public RPC
reads with no key material touched at all. The key is only decrypted, via
dashboard's own _use_key() (same encryption scheme, same security logging,
same best-effort memory scrub), for the one wallet+chain pair this cycle
that actually needs a top-up.
